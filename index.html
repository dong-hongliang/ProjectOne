            My career goal is to become a graphic designer in the future,
            that is also the reason why I am pursuing a bachelor's degree 
            in visual communication design in SFSU. This is my second semester 
            here after transferring from CCSF. I have been taking design classes 
            there too and got my design foundation certificate. By learning the 
            basics of design, it allows me to see more creativity about things 
            that are around us in daily life. I am interested in the field of 
            graphic design mainly in the way that things can be created in 
            different approaches and not limited with solutions. I am more towards 
            print projects like poster design, and branding. Some of the strengths 
            as a designer for me will be layout, the placement of things within 
            grid and alignment. Listening is also one of the strengths and patience. 
            Some of the weaknesses as a designer for me will be the use of color 
            and presenting work as explaining in front of a group about the process 
            and final solution.
